“Raipur Smart Connect” – Unified Civic Engagement Platform
🔹 Problem:

Citizens waste time visiting Nagar Nigam offices for small queries.

Complaints often get lost, and people have no transparency about progress.

Authorities can’t easily prioritize issues or measure citizen satisfaction.

🔹 Solution:

A single digital platform (mobile app + web + WhatsApp/Telegram bot) that provides:

AI Chatbot (Personal Assistant):

24/7 multilingual chatbot for FAQs, water bill queries, tax deadlines, bus info, etc.

Complaint registration + ticket generation.

Real-time updates on complaint progress.

Community Problem Solver (Collaboration Hub):

Citizens upload civic issues with photos/videos + GPS.

Others can upvote → helps validate priority issues.

Volunteers & NGOs can take up small initiatives (cleanliness drives, awareness campaigns).

Nagar Nigam dashboard shows heatmaps of issues.

Integrated Notifications + Alerts:

Flood alerts, water supply changes, traffic updates, tax reminders.

Push notifications on WhatsApp + app.

🔹 Key Features Flow:

Citizen opens chatbot → asks: “When will my garbage be collected?” → Chatbot answers directly.

Citizen sees overflowing garbage → uploads photo → complaint gets ID.

Other citizens upvote the same issue → authority gets higher priority alert.

Nagar Nigam officer assigns issue → status updated in app.

Citizen + community see transparency → trust increases.

🔹 Tech Stack (Hackathon Feasible):

Frontend: React Native (app) + React.js (web).

Chatbot Engine: Rasa / Dialogflow / LangChain with Hugging Face models for Hindi/English NLP.

Backend: Python (FastAPI/Flask) or Node.js.

Database: PostgreSQL + Redis for quick query handling.

Map Integration: Google Maps / OpenStreetMap.

Notification System: Firebase + WhatsApp Business API.

🔹 Impact:

✅ Citizens – Easy access, transparent complaint tracking, multilingual support.
✅ Authorities – Data-driven insights, heatmaps of problems, reduced helpline workload.
✅ Community – Collaborative problem-solving, volunteer participation, gamified rewards.
✅ Scalability – Can be replicated across other smart cities.

⚡ Hackathon Pitch Angle:
“Instead of building two separate systems, we created an integrated smart platform where citizens can ask questions, raise complaints, and collaborate with their community — while authorities get real-time insights to solve city challenges faster.”
