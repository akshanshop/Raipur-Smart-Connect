# Distance-Based Map Filtering Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented location-based filtering for the Citizens dashboard map. The map now shows only problems within a configurable distance from the user's current location, while the Officials dashboard remains unchanged and displays all problems.

## Changes Made

### 1. Modified Components
- **File**: `client/src/components/maps-integration.tsx`
- **Component**: `MapsIntegration` (used only in Citizens dashboard and home page)

### 2. Key Features Added

#### A. User Location Detection
- Automatically detects user's location on component mount using the Geolocation API
- Sets map center to user's location when available
- Falls back to default Raipur coordinates if location is unavailable

#### B. Distance Calculation
- Implemented Haversine formula for accurate distance calculation between coordinates
- Calculates distance in kilometers between user location and each problem
- Formula accounts for Earth's curvature for precise measurements

#### C. Distance Filter Options
Added a new dropdown filter with the following options:
- **All Areas**: Shows all problems (default behavior)
- **Within 5 km**: Shows problems within 5 kilometers
- **Within 10 km**: Shows problems within 10 kilometers
- **Within 20 km**: Shows problems within 20 kilometers
- **Within 50 km**: Shows problems within 50 kilometers

#### D. Dynamic User Feedback
The integration notice now provides contextual information:
- If location is detected and "All Areas" is selected: "Showing all issues in your city. Use the distance filter to see nearby issues only."
- If location is detected and a radius is selected: "Showing issues within [X]km of your location. Change the distance filter to see more or fewer issues."
- If location is not available: "Showing all issues. Allow location access to see issues near you."

### 3. Technical Implementation

#### State Management
```typescript
const [userLocation, setUserLocation] = useState<[number, number] | null>(null);
const [distanceRadius, setDistanceRadius] = useState<string>("all");
```

#### Distance Calculation Function
```typescript
const calculateDistance = (lat1: number, lon1: number, lat2: number, lon2: number): number => {
  const R = 6371; // Earth's radius in kilometers
  const dLat = (lat2 - lat1) * Math.PI / 180;
  const dLon = (lon2 - lon1) * Math.PI / 180;
  const a = 
    Math.sin(dLat/2) * Math.sin(dLat/2) +
    Math.cos(lat1 * Math.PI / 180) * Math.cos(lat2 * Math.PI / 180) *
    Math.sin(dLon/2) * Math.sin(dLon/2);
  const c = 2 * Math.atan2(Math.sqrt(a), Math.sqrt(1-a));
  return R * c; // Distance in kilometers
};
```

#### Filtering Logic
```typescript
const filteredIssues = allIssues.filter((issue: MapIssue) => {
  const matchesPriority = priorityFilter === "all" || issue.priority === priorityFilter;
  
  // Filter by distance from user location
  if (distanceRadius !== "all" && userLocation && issue.latitude && issue.longitude) {
    const distance = calculateDistance(
      userLocation[0],
      userLocation[1],
      parseFloat(issue.latitude),
      parseFloat(issue.longitude)
    );
    const radiusKm = parseInt(distanceRadius);
    if (distance > radiusKm) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  
  return matchesPriority;
});
```

### 4. Dashboards Impact

#### Citizens Dashboard (`client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx`)
- ✅ **UPDATED**: Uses `MapsIntegration` component
- ✅ Now shows distance-filtered problems based on user location
- ✅ Provides better local awareness for citizens

#### Officials Dashboard (`client/src/pages/officials-dashboard.tsx`)
- ✅ **UNCHANGED**: Has its own separate map implementation
- ✅ Continues to show ALL problems in the city
- ✅ Officials can see the complete picture of all issues

### 5. User Experience Flow

1. **Initial Load**:
   - Browser requests location permission
   - User grants permission
   - Map centers on user's location
   - All problems displayed by default ("All Areas" selected)

2. **Filtering**:
   - User selects a distance radius (e.g., "Within 10 km")
   - Map updates to show only problems within that radius
   - Heatmap, density, and individual marker views all respect the filter
   - Dynamic notice updates to inform user of current filter

3. **Privacy**:
   - If user denies location: Map shows all problems with default center
   - User can still manually select distance filters
   - Graceful fallback ensures functionality without location access

### 6. Benefits

#### For Citizens:
- **Better Focus**: See only relevant, nearby problems
- **Reduced Clutter**: Map is less overwhelming with local issues only
- **Community Awareness**: Understand what's happening in your neighborhood
- **Actionable Information**: Can physically visit and verify nearby issues

#### For Officials:
- **Complete Overview**: Still see all city-wide problems
- **Strategic Planning**: Can identify problem hotspots across entire city
- **No Change**: Workflow remains exactly the same

### 7. Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with location permission granted**:
   - Verify map centers on user location
   - Test each distance filter option
   - Confirm problem counts match selected radius

2. **Test with location permission denied**:
   - Verify graceful fallback to default center
   - Confirm all problems shown
   - Check that user feedback message is appropriate

3. **Test different view modes**:
   - Individual markers
   - Heatmap view
   - Density view (by count)
   - Verify all respect distance filtering

## Files Modified
- `client/src/components/maps-integration.tsx` - Main implementation

## Files Verified (Unchanged)
- `client/src/pages/officials-dashboard.tsx` - Officials map remains unchanged
- `client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx` - Citizens dashboard uses updated component
- `client/src/pages/home.tsx` - Home page uses updated component
