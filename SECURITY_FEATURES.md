# 🔒 Comprehensive Security & Anti-Spam System

## Overview
Your application now has a **military-grade security system** that automatically detects and blocks spam, fake requests, scammers, and abusive users. The system protects your platform 24/7 with multiple layers of defense.

---

## 🛡️ Security Features Implemented

### 1. **Intelligent Rate Limiting**
Prevents users from spamming the system with too many requests:

| Action | Limit | Window |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Complaints | 5 requests | Per minute |
| Comments | 10 requests | Per minute |
| Chat Messages | 20 requests | Per minute |
| Upvotes | 30 requests | Per minute |
| General API | 50 requests | Per minute |

**How it works:**
- Tracks requests per user and per IP address
- Automatically resets after the time window
- Different limits for different actions based on typical usage

---

### 2. **Three-Strike Warning System**
Progressive penalties that give users chances to correct their behavior:

1. **1st Strike (Low)** ⚠️
   - Warning notification sent
   - User can continue using the platform
   - Example: "Unusual activity detected. Please follow community guidelines."

2. **2nd Strike (Medium)** ⚠️
   - Security alert with details
   - Stronger warning message
   - Example: "Multiple suspicious requests detected. Next violation may result in suspension."

3. **3rd Strike (High)** 🚨
   - Final warning before block
   - User on last chance
   - Example: "Your account has been flagged. Next violation will result in a 30-minute block."

4. **4th Strike (Critical)** 🔒
   - **30-minute automatic block**
   - IP address also blocked
   - Example: "Account blocked for 30 minutes due to spam/abuse detection."

---

### 3. **Content Validation & Spam Detection**

#### Spam Keyword Blocking
Automatically rejects content containing:
- Gambling terms (casino, lottery, betting)
- Scam keywords (free money, get rich quick, bitcoin scams)
- Adult content keywords
- Promotional spam (click here, limited offer, act now)
- And many more...

#### Pattern Recognition
Detects suspicious patterns:
- 🔗 Multiple URLs (especially suspicious domains like .xyz, .tk, .ml)
- 💳 Credit card number patterns
- 📢 EXCESSIVE CAPITALIZATION (>50% caps = spam)
- 🔁 Repeated characters (aaaaaaaaaa = spam pattern)

#### Comment Protection
- Every comment is validated before posting
- Spam comments are blocked instantly
- User receives immediate notification with the reason

---

### 4. **Duplicate Submission Prevention**
Stops users from submitting the same content repeatedly:

- **Tracks submissions** for 5 minutes
- **Exact match detection** (case-insensitive)
- **Automatic rejection** of duplicate:
  - Complaints
  - Comments
  - Community issues
- **Warning sent** to user explaining the duplicate

---

### 5. **AI-Powered Spam Detection** (Already Existing)
Enhanced with the new security layer:

- GPT-5 analyzes all complaints and community posts
- Detects fake, spam, irrelevant, and abusive content
- 70%+ confidence triggers automatic rejection
- Categories: legitimate, spam, fake, irrelevant, abusive
- Works in combination with the new security features

---

### 6. **Automated Warning System**

Every violation triggers an **instant notification** to the user:

**Warning Notifications Include:**
- ⚠️ Severity level (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
- 📝 Specific reason for the warning
- 🌐 IP address involved
- 🕒 Timestamp of the incident
- ℹ️ What happens next / consequences

**Example Warning:**
```
🚨 Final Warning

Your account has been flagged for spam/abuse. 
Next violation will result in a 30-minute block.

Reason: Duplicate complaint submission
IP Address: 192.168.1.100
Timestamp: Oct 10, 2025, 9:45 AM

Please ensure you follow community guidelines.
```

---

### 7. **IP-Based Blocking**
Persistent violators get their IP addresses permanently blocked:

- ❌ Blocked IPs cannot access protected endpoints
- 🔄 IP block persists across user sessions
- 🛡️ Prevents ban evasion through new accounts
- 👮 Officials can manually unblock if needed

---
